## Project for Delta Hacks

## Inspiration: 
For many people, keeping track of day-to-day items can be difficult. This is only exacerbated with the progression of age with many senior citizens either forced to adopt increasingly simplistic lifestyles or risk forgetting crucial actions.

## What it does
This application seeks to remedy this problem by providing a straightforward daily planner to keep seniors on track and eliminate forgetful errors in their day-to-day life. 

## How we built it
Using React JavaScript Next.js framework, we created a web-based application which presents users with prompts regarding the required actions for the day. The user responds with a 'yes' or 'no' on whether they have yet completed the task. Once done the program outputs a summary of the completed tasks and notifies the user on the tasks still needing to be done. 

## Challenges we ran into
For most of our group, this was the first time using React and thus, the learning curve regarding the software was quite steep. It took a considerable amount of time to learn enough to complete the app. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This project served as a great learning experience for React and the related environments. Even though this was our first time using the software, we still managed to create a functioning application. 

## What we learned
On a technical front, we learned the basics of React programming as well as git commands, Vercel web hosting, Next.js, and Node.js. On a general side, this was the first Hackathon for most of our team members and we learned about problem identification, solution conception, and project evolution. Most importantly we learned that there is a lot we don't know about coding in general and were motivated to further explore the vast world of computer programming. 

## What's next for To Do or !To Do
We could look into adding role based access control to allow loved ones or other friends of the user to upload daily checklists. We could also look into improving the user interface and adding timer-based notifications to the app.
